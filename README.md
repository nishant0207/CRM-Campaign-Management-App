Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

	•	Node.js and npm
	•	MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
	•	Firebase project (for Google Authentication)

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/xeno-crm-campaign-app.git
cd xeno-crm-campaign-app

2. Backend Setup

	1.	Navigate to the Backend Directory:

cd xeno-crm


	2.	Install Backend Dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend root directory and add the following environment variables:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/xeno_crm
PORT=3000


	4.	Run the Backend Server:

node app.js

The backend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

3. Frontend Setup

	1.	Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

cd xeno-crm-frontend


	2.	Install Frontend Dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Firebase Configuration:
Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console and enable Google Authentication. Get the Firebase configuration settings and add them to src/firebaseConfig.js:

import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth, GoogleAuthProvider } from 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const googleProvider = new GoogleAuthProvider();


	4.	Set Up API URL:
In src/services/api.js, set the base URL for the backend API:

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';


	5.	Run the Frontend Server:

npm start

The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3001.

Environment Variables

	•	MONGODB_URI: MongoDB connection string (required for backend)
	•	PORT: Port for backend server
	•	Firebase Config: Add Firebase keys directly in firebaseConfig.js for authentication.

Usage

	1.	Authentication:
	•	Visit http://localhost:3001.
	•	Sign in with your Google account to access the dashboard.
	2.	Dashboard:
	•	Create Campaign: Define a campaign with a target audience based on conditions like spending, visits, and last visit.
	•	Send Messages: Click “Send Messages” for each campaign to send messages to the audience and track delivery.
	•	View Statistics: Navigate to the Statistics page to view cumulative stats for all campaigns.

Deployment

Backend Deployment (Heroku or Render)

	1.	Set Up Environment Variables on the platform for MONGODB_URI and PORT.
	2.	Deploy the backend code to your chosen platform.
	3.	Update the API URL in api.js on the frontend to point to the deployed backend URL.

Frontend Deployment (Netlify or Vercel)

	1.	Build the Frontend:

npm run build


	2.	Deploy to Netlify or Vercel, connecting the repository and specifying the root as xeno-crm-frontend.
